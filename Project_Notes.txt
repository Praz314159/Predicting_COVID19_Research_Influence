10/8/20: Completing coauthorship build and also thinking about feature set for paper quality. Realizing that the 
datasets need to be cleaned. In particular, it looks like author names aren't consistently delimited by semicolons. 

TASK: clean datasets 

10/9/20: Was able to automate deletion of spaces at beginning and end of author name splits. Wouldn't have to do this
if data was cleaned properly to begin with. Annoying. Next, have to take care of delimeters.

10/10/20: I have a working dictionary. However, the dictionary includes in the coauthor list the name of the author 
(key), which means that each edge will have a self-loop. This can be taken care of later, when constructing the graphThat is, all self-loops can easily be removed. Redundant edges are already automatically excluded in network 
construction.

10/11:20: Now have working network generation. Had to convert to data structure used by networkx, dict of dicts. 
Next, I have to reduce node size so network structure is more apparent for plot size. Also have to do the delimiter
scrubbing on dataset.
